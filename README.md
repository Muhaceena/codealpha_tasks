# CodeAlpha Internship Projects

Welcome to the CodeAlpha internship projects repository! This repository contains the solutions for three distinct tasks: Hangman Game, Stock Portfolio, and Chatbot. The tasks focus on different aspects of programming, from game development to data management and AI integration.

## Task 1: Hangman Game
### Description:
The Hangman game is a classic word-guessing game where the player has to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters. For each incorrect guess, part of a stick figure is drawn, and the player has a limited number of wrong guesses before the game ends.

### Features:
- Random word selection from a predefined list.
- User input for guessing letters.
- Display of hangman figure with each incorrect guess.
- Winning/losing conditions with feedback.

### How to run:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the `hangman.py` script.
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to guess the word.

## Task 2: Stock Portfolio
### Description:
This project simulates managing a stock portfolio. The user can add, view, and remove stocks, as well as track their performance based on daily stock price changes. It includes functionalities to calculate the total portfolio value and monitor the profit/loss of individual stocks.

### Features:
- Add, view, and remove stocks in the portfolio.
- Track stock prices and calculate portfolio value.
- Profit and loss calculation for individual stocks.
- Data is saved locally for persistent tracking.

### How to run:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the `stockportfolio.py` script.
3. Follow the prompts to manage your stock portfolio.

## Task 3: Chatbot
### Description:
This project implements a basic chatbot that can respond to user input with predefined responses. The chatbot is designed to simulate conversation by matching user queries with keywords and returning appropriate answers.

### Features:
- Basic conversation capabilities.
- Keyword-based matching for predefined responses.
- Easy to expand by adding more responses and functionalities.

### How to run:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the `chatbot.py` script.
3. Start chatting by entering messages in the console.
